# EdTutor
## Inspiration
We saw that tutors are heavily needed for students to deeply understand academic materials, and we also saw people who use their free time to educate, for money or just purely out of the passion to share knowledge. These all inspired us to create a web application that connects users and allows them to gain expertise in their fields of interest, maximize productivity in studying, or become individual educators and apply their knowledge. And here comes EdTutor -- an all-in-one learning platform that incorporates online courses, question-and-answer forum, customizable study planner, and other student services!

## What it does
In EdTutor, users can create and upload their own instructional videos; anybody can take those courses; users can post and answer questions; students and tutors can engage in conversations with each other; transactions can take place; and every student has their own learning space to plan their learning pathway.

## How we built it
After a discussion of what we wanted to create, we used Figma to construct the blueprint of our web application. We then quickly decided the languages we were going to use since we all have the experience of using Python. We also decided to use the Flask framework since it's lightweight and simple to create a prototype. We also made use of Bootstrap to give our web app a more responsive and dynamic structure.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge we encountered was developing our HTML code. We faced many formatting issues, which caused our web app to not look or function in its intended way, and we had to spend a great amount of time to solve them. We also had troubles connecting the front end and back end; for example, linking our HTML code with Python, such as having a button on our web app that allows users to upload their own videos, was troublesome.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of how much we learned and were able to complete in a weekend. The look of the UI of our product makes us feel rewarded as this is proof of our efforts, considering some of us had little experience with HTML and CSS before this Hackathon. Moreover, we are also extremely proud of our passion and perseverance to the very end, help and encouragement to each other throughout the 48 hours, and our collaboration that made this project possible.

## What we learned
For some of us, it was our first time using frameworks such as Flask to create a web application, and it was even our first time participating in a Hackathon. We had to force ourselves out of our comfort zone and push ourselves to our limits, but it was a great opportunity that allowed us to learn new skills at an incredible speed. We also got a taste of teamwork and time management in project development. The idea of creating a web application in just a weekend with someone we had never met before was, at first, intimidating to us, but we learned how to communicate and collaborate efficiently, which made everything possible. We also improved our perseverance skills through this Hackathon; due to the time limitation, we had to code and debug at a high intensity, and our anxiety peaked especially when we couldn't figure out how to fix an error. However, we were able to overcome all of these by helping and encouraging each other and never giving up.

## What's next for Edtutor
Due to time limitations, we were only able to develop a the frame of our web app and it's missing many interactive functions. Our immediate next step would first be fully connecting the front-end with back-end so that the features are responsive. We also look forward to working on implement cloud servers so that all the across network features would be functional.
